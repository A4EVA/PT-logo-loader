# Build PineTime Firmware in the Cloud with GitHub Actions

![](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/cloud-title.png)

Firmware programming has always been cumbersome...

1. Get a proper computer (Windows tends to be problematic)

1. Install the tools and libraries to cross-compile our firmware

1. If the build fails, tweak the build scripts (It's probably just Windows)

1. If the build still fails... We're stuck!

Nowhere as fun as a game like Fortnite!

_Can Firmware Programming be as fun as Fortnite?_

Well Fortnite runs in the Cloud on massive servers...

What if we could build our firmware in the Cloud?

In under 2 minutes?!

Firmware programming has always been tedious and not fun

Fortnite runs in the Cloud on massive servers...
What if we could build our firmware in the Cloud?
In under 2 minutes?

Just as enjoyable as Fortnite
Less violent
And in 3D real life with our real fingers instead of 2D

Future
Bluetooth flashing

FYI our plans for putting in Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

so whenever we check in changes to the source code, it will auto build the firmware

there will probably be 2 versions of this Continuous Integration...


(1) For maintaining the central PineTime firmware


(2) For newbies to build their PineTime firmware automatically in the cloud, without any software to be installed on their PCs


This is super cool, that makes so much so simple, no hassle with finding the right version of every software!

but of course there will be folks who dont like to build things in a cloud 

but the good news that you can see exactly what steps we use to build firmware in the cloud

and replicate on your own pc

and with actual logs to compare the results

so its super educational yay!
