# Convert Go to Flutter and Dart for PineTime Companion App

Can we take a __single code base__... And turn it into a mobile app for __Android, iOS and Linux phones__ (like PinePhone)?

And code it in a __modern programming language__ with __Garbage Collection__... Without the scary C pointers?

And talk Bluetooth Low Energy to other gadgets... Like [__PineTime Smart Watch__](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PineTime)?

__Yes we can!__ Based on the quick experiment described in this article.

Read on to learn how we are building the [Flutter Companion App](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion) for PineTime Smart Watch... By doing a line-by-line conversion from Go (on Linux) to Flutter + Dart (on Android and iOS).

The code is not 100% identical, but it will save the PineTime FOSS Community a lot of effort in maintaining the Android, iOS, Linux versions of the PineTime Companion App.

I'll explain how this Linux Command Line App in Go...

_(Which will eventually be dressed up with [`gotk3`](https://github.com/gotk3/gotk3), the GTK3 library for Go)_

...Was converted line by line to this Flutter app for Android and iOS...

_(The highlighted part shows the identical responses returned by PineTime to both apps over Bluetooth LE. So it really works!)_

I'll be using the code in this article to create the open source __PineTime Companion App__ for Android and iOS. So that we can flash our PineTime Smart Watches wirelessly, sync the date and time, show notifications, chart our heart rate, ...

Flutter makes it really easy to maintain a single code base for Android and iOS... And `flutter_blue` makes Bluetooth LE coding so simple!
