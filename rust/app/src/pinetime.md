# PineTime doesn't run Linux... But that's OK!

PineTime works great with open source embedded operating systems like __FreeRTOS, RIOT, Mynewt, wasp-os, Zephyr,__ ... None of which are based on Linux!

Think of PineTime as a supercharged BBC micro:bit (or Arduino Uno) that comes with Bluetooth LE, colour LCD display (240 x 240), touchscreen, heart rate sensor and accelerometer.

__PineTime is incredibly hackable:__ Flash our own firmware, build our own watch faces, render graphics on the touchscreen, ... The PineTime FOSS Community is always happy to help you hack PineTime!

C is the most common language for coding PineTime. If you're familiar with Python, try coding PineTime with MicroPython on wasp-os.

If you're into cutting edge coding, check out Rust Embedded (and Real Time For the Masses) on PineTime.
