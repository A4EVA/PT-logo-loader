# PineTime doesn't run Linux... But that's OK!

PineTime works great with open source embedded software platforms like __Arduino, FreeRTOS, RIOT, Mynewt, wasp-os, Zephyr,__ ... None of which are based on Linux!

Think of PineTime as a supercharged BBC micro:bit (or Arduino Uno) that comes with Bluetooth LE, colour LCD display (240 x 240), touchscreen, heart rate sensor and accelerometer.

__PineTime is incredibly hackable:__ Flash our own firmware, build our own watch faces, render graphics on the touchscreen, ... The PineTime FOSS Community is always happy to help you hack PineTime!

__C is the most common language__ for coding PineTime. If you're familiar with Python, try coding PineTime with __MicroPython on wasp-os.__

If you're into cutting edge coding, check out __Rust Embedded__ (and Real Time For the Masses) on PineTime.

# Some PineTime wiring needed

PineTime ships as a __Developer Kit__... Get ready to do some wiring!

Some newbies find it tricky to connect to the SWD Port inside PineTime, please chat with us online for tips.

I recommend using a __Raspberry Pi to remove Flash ROM protection__ from PineTime (this step is mandatory), also to flash and debug the PineTime firmware.

Advanced firmware coders will find __ST-Link V2__ more efficient for flashing and debugging the firmware. (Though ST-Link V2 can't be used for removing Flash ROM protection)
