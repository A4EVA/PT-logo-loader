__We ‚ù§Ô∏è Old Underwear...__

They feel comfy, they fit our contours. Nevermind the holes and the old stains ü§¢

__X11 is like Old Underwear.__ It's been around for 30 years... Yet we still use it inspite of its feature gaps and wonky quirks.

__PinePhone on Ubuntu Touch feels like... New Underwear.__

It runs Linux but it has none of the legacy X11 code. Because it's optimised for a great mobile experience with __Wayland.__

But New Underwear feels uncomfortable. So today we'll learn Wayland and understand how apps are built with Wayland.

Hopefully someday we'll move on to newer, simpler app frameworks (like LVGL and Flutter) as we discard our Old Underwear: X11, SDL, GTK, Qt, ...

# Wayland vs X11

I lied about Wayland being New Underwear... It's not really that New!
