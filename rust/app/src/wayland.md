_Work-in-progress LVGL GUI Framework ported to Wayland EGL on PinePhone with Ubuntu Touch_

__We ‚ù§Ô∏è &nbsp; Old Underwear...__

They feel comfy, they fit our contours. Nevermind the holes and the old stains ü§¢

__X11 is like Old Underwear.__ It's been around for 30 years... Yet we still use it inspite of its feature gaps and wonky quirks.

__PinePhone on Ubuntu Touch feels like... New Underwear.__

It runs Linux but it has none of the legacy X11 code. Because it's optimised for a great mobile experience with __Wayland.__

But New Underwear feels uncomfortable. So today we'll learn Wayland and understand how apps are built with Wayland.

Hopefully someday we'll move on to newer, simpler app frameworks (like [LVGL](https://lvgl.io/) and Flutter) as we discard our Old Underwear: X11, SDL, GTK, Qt, ...

# How X11 works

[X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) is the Graphical Display Service that runs on most Linux desktops and notebooks.

Let's hunt for the X11 Service on Pinebook Pro...

![X11 Service on Pinebook Pro](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-pinebook.png)

That's the X11 Service... A __2.2 MB__ executable named __`Xorg`__. 

The X11 Service controls the rendering of Linux apps (as well as the keyboard and mouse input) like this...

![X11 Architecture](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-x11.png)

(Adapted from ["Wayland Architecture"](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/architecture.html))

1. At the top we have the Linux programs running on our Linux machine: __Terminal, Editor, Web Browser__.

    Each program renders its graphical display and transmits the raw graphics to the X11 Service (via a local TCP socket).

1. X11 Service forwards the rendered graphics to the [__Window Manager / Compositor__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager).

    The Window Manager / Compositor is provided by the __Desktop Environment__: Xfce, KDE, Gnome, ...

1. The Window Manager / Compositor wraps the rendered graphics into Display Windows and __"decorates"__ them with scrollbars, title bar and minimise / maximise / close buttons.

    The Window Manager / Compositor then draws the Display Windows into a __Screen Buffer__ according to their screen coordinates.

1. The Screen Buffer is rendered to our screen by the X11 Service, talking to the __Linux Display Driver__.

1. Any __keyboard and mouse input__ is captured by the X11 Service, and forwarded to the programs.

_Why is X11 so complex? So many hops?_

Because X11 was designed for Distributed Computing Systems.

Here's how I used (abused?) X11R4 at [UIUC Systems Research Group](http://srg.cs.illinois.edu/) way back in 1990 (30 years ago!)...

![Distributed X11 System](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-uiuc.png)

Thankfully things are a lot simpler now, lemme explain...

# Wayland on Ubuntu Touch

_Do we need overlapping or tiled windows on PinePhone?_

_Do we need to need to decorate PinePhone windows with a title bar and minimise / maximise / close buttons?_

_Do we even need any windows on PinePhone?_

No! Because each PinePhone app takes control of the entire screen!

PinePhone uses a simpler Graphical Display Service: the [__Wayland Compositor__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)#Wayland_compositors).

Let's hunt for the Wayland Compositor on PinePhone...

![Wayland Compositor on PinePhone](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-compositor.png)

That's the Wayland Compositor... A __262 KB__ executable named `unity-system-compositor`. 

_Compare that with the 2.2 MB X11 Server on Pinebook Pro!_

Here's how the Wayland Compositor controls apps and touchscreen input on PinePhone with Ubuntu Touch...

![Wayland Architecture](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-arch.png)

(Adapted from ["Wayland Architecture"](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/architecture.html) and ["EGL API"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGL_(API)))

1. At the top we have the apps running on our phone: __Terminal, Editor, Web Browser__.

    Since each app runs fullscreen, only the active app will be rendered.

    When then app starts, it queries the __Wayland Compositor__ for the graphical display interfaces available. (They talk via a [Linux socket file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types#Socket): `/run/user/32011/wayland-0`)

1. Wayland Compositor returns the [__EGL Interface__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGL_(API)) to the app.

1. App calls the EGL Interface to [__render OpenGL graphics__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL) directly to the __Linux Display Driver__.

1. Linux Display Driver forwards the OpenGL rendering commands to the [__GPU to update the screen__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit).

1. Any __touchscreen input__ is captured by the Wayland Compositor, and forwarded to the active app.

Wayland looks so much simpler and faster than X11!

_Wayland is designed for OpenGL and GPUs?_

Yes! And I lied about Wayland being New Underwear... Wayland is not really that New!

Wayland was first released in 2008 ([11 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)))... Yet it was designed around OpenGL and GPUs, the same tech that powers our beautiful games today. ([And websites too](https://youtu.be/DNBk9hnPkTY))

Read on to learn how to render our own OpenGL graphics with Wayland and Ubuntu Touch on PinePhone...

![Rendering a yellow rectangle with Wayland and OpenGL on PinePhone](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-egl.jpg)

_Rendering a yellow rectangle with Wayland and OpenGL on PinePhone_

# Render OpenGL Graphics with Wayland

Here's the function that calls OpenGL to render the yellow box above: [`pinephone-mir/egl.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L44-L60)

```c
/// Render the OpenGL ES2 display
static void render_display() {
    puts("Rendering display...");

    //  Fill the rectangular region with yellow
    glClearColor(
        1.0,  //  Red
        1.0,  //  Green
        0.0,  //  Blue
        1.0   //  Alpha
    );
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

    // Render now
    glFlush();
}
```

`render_display()` looks exactly like normal OpenGL, and it works on PinePhone with Wayland! (Thanks to Ubuntu Touch)

Two things to note...

1. PinePhone supports a popular subset of OpenGL, known as [__OpenGL for Embedded Systems__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_ES) Version 2.0.

    OpenGL ES is optimised for Embedded Devices. OpenGL ES is used by many mobile and console games today.

1. To render OpenGL ES graphics, we need to get the OpenGL ES Context and Window Surface from Wayland

Before calling `render_display()`, we fetch the OpenGL Window Surface from Wayland like so: [`pinephone-mir/egl.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L167-L189)

```c
static struct wl_egl_window *egl_window;  //  Wayland EGL Window
static EGLSurface egl_surface;            //  EGL Surface

/// Create the OpenGL window and render it
static void create_window(void) {
    //  Create an EGL Window from a Wayland Surface 
    egl_window = wl_egl_window_create(surface, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
    assert(egl_window != EGL_NO_SURFACE);  //  Failed to create OpenGL Window

    //  Create an OpenGL Window Surface for rendering
    egl_surface = eglCreateWindowSurface(egl_display, egl_conf,
        egl_window, NULL);
    assert(egl_surface != NULL);  //  Failed to create OpenGL Window Surface

    //  Set the current rendering surface
    EGLBoolean madeCurrent = eglMakeCurrent(egl_display, egl_surface,
        egl_surface, egl_context);
    assert(madeCurrent);  //  Failed to set rendering surface

    //  Render the display
    render_display();

    //  Swap the display buffers to make the display visible
    EGLBoolean swappedBuffers = eglSwapBuffers(egl_display, egl_surface);
    assert(swappedBuffers);  //  Failed to swap display buffers
}
```

Functions named `wl_egl_...` are provided by the Wayland EGL Interface.  Functions named `egl...` come from the cross-platform [Mesa 3D Graphics Library](https://docs.mesa3d.org/egl.html#:~:text=The%20main%20library%20(%20libEGL%20)%20is,directly%20dispatched%20to%20the%20drivers.).

_EGL vs OpenGL... What's the difference?_

In Wayland, EGL is the Enabler for OpenGL. 

Wayland only understands EGL and it will gladly hand us EGL objects... But it's up to us to transform EGL into OpenGL for rendering.

In the code above, we take a Wayland Surface `surface` and transform it into an EGL Window `egl_window`...

```c
    //  Create an EGL Window from a Wayland Surface 
    egl_window = wl_egl_window_create(surface, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
```

Then we create an OpenGL Window Surface `egl_surface` from that EGL Window...

```c
    //  Create an OpenGL Window Surface for rendering
    egl_surface = eglCreateWindowSurface(egl_display, egl_conf,
        egl_window, NULL);
```

And we begin the OpenGL rendering...

```c
    //  Set the current rendering surface
    EGLBoolean madeCurrent = eglMakeCurrent(egl_display, egl_surface,
        egl_surface, egl_context);

    //  Render the display
    render_display();

    //  Swap the display buffers to make the display visible
    eglSwapBuffers(egl_display, egl_surface);
```

[`pinephone-mir/egl.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L103-L112)

```c
static struct wl_region *region;  //  Wayland Region

/// Create an opaque region for OpenGL rendering
static void create_opaque_region(void) {
    puts("Creating opaque region...");

    region = wl_compositor_create_region(compositor);
    assert(region != NULL);  //  Failed to create EGL Region

    wl_region_add(region, 0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
    wl_surface_set_opaque_region(surface, region);
}
```

Here's how we get the OpenGL Context...

    //  Get the EGL Configurations
    EGLint count, n;
    eglGetConfigs(egl_display, NULL, 0, &count);
    printf("EGL has %d configs\n", count);
    EGLConfig *configs = calloc(count, sizeof *configs);
    eglChooseConfig(egl_display, config_attribs,
        configs, count, &n);

    //  Choose the first EGL Configuration
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        EGLint size;

    //  Create the EGL Context based on the EGL Display and Configuration
    egl_context = eglCreateContext(egl_display, egl_conf,
        EGL_NO_CONTEXT, context_attribs);
    assert(egl_context != NULL);  //  Failed to create EGL Context
}

    //  Disconnect from the Wayland Display
    wl_display_disconnect(display);

}
```

Building a Wayland app is refreshingly simple (if you're used to GDK, Qt and SDL).

Here'a how we build the app in `egl.c` on a Linux machine (that has the Wayland, EGL and OpenGL ES2 libraries installed)...

```bash
# Build the Wayland EGL app
gcc \
    -g \
    -o egl \
    egl.c \
    -Wl,-Map=egl.map \
    -L/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/mesa-egl \
    -lwayland-client \
    -lwayland-server \
    -lwayland-egl \
    -lEGL \
    -lGLESv2
```

```bash
# Start the Weston Wayland Compositor on our computer with the PinePhone screen dimensions
weston --width=720 --height=1398 &

# Run the Wayland EGL app
./egl
```

And we'll see this...

# What I like about Ubuntu Touch on PinePhone

TODO

AppArmor is good, because iOS and Android have similar apps security

Read-only file system is good (system files are read-only by default, user files are read-write). Helps to prevent security holes. (Even PineTime has a read-only Flash ROM)

Why is Qt supported on Ubuntu Touch and not GTK? Because building a Linux mobile app requires mobile-friendly widgets.

I think Qt has more mobile-friendly widgets, even through the internal plumbing is way too complicated.

When I get GTK running on Ubuntu Touch, I will face the same problem with widgets. And I have to make GTK widgets look and feel consistent with Qt / Ubuntu Touch widgets.

Older kernel base in Ubuntu Touch... I don't do kernel hacking much so it doesn't matter to me.

I think for mobiles we only need to support a few common chipsets, so an older kernel is probably fine.

That explains why Raspberry Pi 4 isn't supported by Ubuntu Touch... The hardware is just too new.

The issues I'm struggling with now... Wayland, GTK3, ... are actually really old stuff. Updating the kernel won't help.

Ubuntu Touch is pure Wayland, none of the legacy X11 stuff. Xwayland is not even there (unless you use the Libertine containers ugh).

The pure Wayland environment causes GTK to break, because GTK assumes some minimal X11 support (i.e. Xwayland).

So Ubuntu Touch is not really that bad for PinePhone... It's just painful for building non-Qt apps. üôÇ
